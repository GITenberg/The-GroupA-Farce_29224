<h3>(1728-1814)</h3>


<p>Most of the literature&mdash;orations as well as broadsides&mdash;created
in America under the heat of the Revolution, was of a strictly
satirical character. Most of the Revolutionary ballads sung at
the time were bitter with hatred against the Loyalist. When
the conflict actually was in progress, the theatres that regaled
the Colonists were closed, and an order from the Continental
Congress declared that theatre-going was an amusement from
which all patriotic people should abstain. These orders or
resolutions were dated October 12, 1778, and October 16. (Seilhamer,
ii, 51.) The playhouses were no sooner closed, however&mdash;much
to the regret of Washington&mdash;than their doors were
thrown wide open by the British troops stationed in Boston,
New York, and Philadelphia. A complete history of the American
stage has to deal with Howe's players, Clinton's players,
and Burgoyne's players.</p>

<p>Of all these Red-Coat Thespians, two demand our attention&mdash;one,
Major Andr&eacute;, a gay, talented actor; the other, General Burgoyne,
whose pride was as much concerned with playwriting as
with generalship. The latter dipped his pen in the satirical inkpot,
and wrote a farce, "The Blockade of Boston." It was
this play that drew forth from a woman, an American playwright,
the retort stinging. This lady was Mrs. Mercy Warren<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
who, although distinguished for being a sister of James Otis,
and the wife of General James Warren, was in her own name
a most important and distinct literary figure during the
Revolution.</p>

<p>So few women appear in the early history of American Drama
that it is well here to mention Mrs. Charlotte Ramsay Lennox
(1720-1804) and Mrs. Susanna Rowson (1762-1824). The former
has the reputation of being the first woman, born in America,
to have written a play, "The Sister" (1769). The author
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>moved to London when she was fifteen, and there it was her
piece was produced, with an epilogue by Oliver Goldsmith. She
is referred to in Boswell's Life of Johnson.</p>

<p>Of Susanna Rowson, whose Memoir has been issued by Rev.
Elias Nason, we know that, as a singer and actress, she created
sufficient reputation in London to attract the attention of Wignell,
the comedian. (Clapp. Boston Stage. 1853, p. 41.)</p>

<p>With her husband, she came to this country in 1793, and,
apart from her professional duties on the stage, wrote a farce,
"Volunteers" (1795), dealing with the Whiskey Insurrection in
Pennsylvania, "The Female Patriot" (1794), "Slaves in Algiers;
or, A Struggle for Freedom" (1794), and "Americans in England"
(1796). All of these were produced. Her literary attainments
were wide, her most popular novel being "Charlotte
Temple, a Tale of Truth" (1790). She likewise compiled many
educational works. (See Wegelin.)</p>

<p>The picture conjured up in our mind of Mrs. Warren is
farthest away from satire. To judge by the costume she wore
when she sat to Copley for her portrait, she must have been
graced with all the feminine wiles of the period. Behold Mrs.
Mercy Warren, satirist, as the records describe her:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Her head-dress is of white lace, trimmed with white satin ribbons.
Her robe is of dark-green satin, with a pompadour waist, trimmed
with point lace. There is a full plait at the back, hanging from the
shoulders, and her sleeves are also of point lace. White illusion,
trimmed with point lace, and fastened with a white satin bow, covers
her neck. The front of the skirt and of the sleeves are elaborately
trimmed with puffings of satin.</p></div>

<p>But however agreeable this picture may be, Mrs. Warren, on
reading Burgoyne's farce, immediately sharpened her pen, and
replied by writing a counter-farce, which she called "The Blockheads;
or, the Affrighted Officers."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was in the prologue to
this play that the poet-dramatist wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your pardon first I crave for this intrusion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The topic's such it looks like a delusion;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And next your candour, for I swear and vow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such an attempt I never made till now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But constant laughing at the Desp'rate fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bastard sons of Mars endur'd of late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Induc'd me thus to minute down the notion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which put my risibles in such commotion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By yankees frighted too! oh, dire to say!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why yankees sure at red-coats faint away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, yes&mdash;They thought so too&mdash;for lack-a-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gen'ral turned the <i>blockade</i> to a play:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor vain poltroons&mdash;with justice we'll retort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call them <i>blockheads</i> for their idle sport.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot test the comparative value of satire
as used by Burgoyne and Mrs. Warren, because the Burgoyne
play is not in existence. But, undoubtedly, our Revolutionary
enthusiast knew how to wield her pen in anger, and she reflects
all of the bitter spirit of the time. Not only is this apparent in
"The Blockheads," but likewise in "The Group," a piece which
holds up to ridicule a number of people well known to the Boston
of that day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Warren was the writer of many plays, as well as being
noted for her "History of the American Revolution" (1805),
and for her slim volume of poems (1790), which follow the conventional
sentiments of the conventionally sentimental English
poetry of that time.</p>

<p>In "The Group" we obtain her interesting impressions, in
dramatic form, of North and Gage and, from the standpoint of
the library, we regard with reverence the little copy of the play
printed on the day before the battle of Lexington&mdash;a slim brochure,
aimed effectively at Tory politicians.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In fact, mention the name Tory to Mrs. Warren, and her wit
was ever ready to sharpen its shafts against British life in
America. That is probably why so many believe she wrote
"The Motley Assembly," a farce, though some there be who
claim that its authorship belongs to J. M. Sewall. Dr. F. W.
Atkinson asserts that this was the first American play to have
in it only American characters.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The satirical farce was a popular dramatic form of the time.
Mrs. Warren was particularly effective in wielding such a
polemic note, for instance, when she deals with the Boston
Massacre in her Tragedy, "The Adulateur" (Boston: Printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and sold at the New Printing-Office, /Near Concert-Hall./
M,DCC,LXXIII./). On the King's side, however, the writers
were just as effective. Such an example is seen in "The Battle
of Brooklyn, A farce of Two Acts: as it was performed at
Long-Island, on Tuesday, the 27th of August, 1776, By the
Representatives of the Tyrants of America, Assembled at
Philadelphia" (Edinburgh: Printed in the Year M.DCC.
LXXVII.), in which the British ridicule all that is Continental,
even Washington. This farce was reprinted in Brooklyn, 1873.</p>

<p>Jonathan Mitchell Sewall's (1748-1808) "A Cure for the
Spleen; or, Amusement for a Winter's Evening" (1775) was
another Tory protest, which carried the following pretentious
subtitle: "Being the substance of a conversation on the Times,
over a friendly tankard and pipe, between Sharp, a country
Parson; Bumper, a country Justice; Fillpot, an inn-keeper;
Graveairs, a Deacon; Trim, a Barber; Brim, a Quaker; Puff,
a late Representative. Taken in short-hand by Roger de
Coverly."</p>

<p>Mrs. Warren was the intimate friend of many interesting
people. It concerns us, however, that her most significant correspondence
of a literary nature was carried on with John Adams,
afterwards President of the United States. This friendship
remained unbroken until such time as Mrs. Warren found it
necessary to picture Adams in her History of the Revolution;
when he objected to the portraiture.</p>

<p>The student of history is beholden to Mr. Adams for many
of those intimate little sketches of Revolutionary and early
national life in America, without which our impressions would
be much the poorer. His admiration for Mrs. Warren was great,
and even in his correspondence with her husband, James Warren,
he never allowed an opportunity to slip for alluding to her work
as a literary force in the life of the time. I note, for example, a
letter he wrote on December 22, 1773, suggesting a theme which
would "become" Mrs. Warren's pen, "which has no equal that
I know of in this country."</p>

<p>In 1775, after "The Group" was written, and, according to
custom, submitted by Warren to John Adams for criticism and
approval, we find him praising Mrs. Warren, and quoting from
her play. So poignantly incisive was Mrs. Warren's satire that
many people would not credit her with the pieces she actually
wrote, and there were those who thought it incredible that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
woman should use satire so openly and so flagrantly as she.
The consequence is, many of her contemporaries attributed the
writing of "The Group" to masculine hands, and this attitude
drew from Mrs. Warren the following letter written to Mr.
Adams:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My next question, sir, you may deem impertinent. Do you remember
who was the author of a little pamphlet entitled, <i>The Group?</i>
To your hand it was committed by the writer. You brought it forward
to the public eye. I will therefore give you my reason for
naming it now. A friend of mine, who lately visited the Athen&aelig;um
[a Boston Library], saw it among a bundle of pamphlets, with a
high encomium of the author, who, he asserted, was Mr. Samuel
Barrett. You can, if you please, give a written testimony contradictory
of the false assertion.</p></div>

<p>This letter was written long after the Revolution, when she
was not loath to let it be known that she was the creator of this
little play, and is clearly indicative of the general attitude the
public had toward Mrs. Warren as an author. Her appeal instantly
called forth a courteous rejoinder from Mr. Adams,
who wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What brain could ever have conceived or suspected Samuel Barrett,
Esquire, to have been the author of "The Group"? The bishop
has neither the natural genius nor the acquired talents, the knowledge
of characters, nor the political principles, sentiments, or feelings, that
could have dictated that pungent drama. His worthy brother, the
Major, might have been as rationally suspected.</p>

<p>I could take my Bible oath to two propositions, 1st. That Bishop
Barrett, in my opinion, was one of the last literary characters in the
world who ought to have been suspected to have written "The
Group." 2d. That there was but one person in the world, male or
female, who could at that time, in my opinion, have written it;
and that person was Madam Mercy Warren, the historical, philosophical,
poetical, and satirical consort of the then Colonel, since
General, James Warren of Plymouth, sister of the great, but forgotten,
James Otis.</p></div>

<p>According to Adams, he immediately went to the Boston
Athen&aelig;um, where his nephew, W. S. Shaw, was Librarian. He
drew from the shelves a copy of "The Group", which had been
bought from the collection of Governor Adams of Massachusetts,
and forthwith, on looking it over, wrote down the original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
names of the people satirized therein.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This copy is still a valuable
possession of the library.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Warren was writing "The Group," she sent it
piecemeal to her husband, who was on the field of battle. He,
being proud of the literary attainments of his wife, sent it
around to his friends, under seal of secrecy. And his appeal to
these friends was very significant of the pride he felt in the manuscript.
Here is what he wrote to Adams, on January 15, 1775:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Inclosed are for your amusement two Acts of a dramatic performance
composed at my particular desire. They go to you as they
came out of the hand of the Copier, without pointing or marking.
If you think it worth while to make any other use of them than a
reading, you will prepare them in that way &amp; give them such
other Corrections &amp; Amendments as your good Judgment shall
suggest.</p></div>

<p>It gradually became known among Warren's friends who the
real writer of the satire was, much to the consternation of Mrs.
Mercy Warren. She was modest to the extreme, usually being
thrust into writing on particular subjects by the enthusiasm of
her friends. For example, she wrote a poem on the Boston
Tea Party, and, in sending it to her husband, she confessed that
it was a task</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>done in consequence of the request of a much respected friend. It
was wrote off with little attention.... I do not think it has sufficient
merit for the public eye.</p></div>

<p>By the same post, she sent him another scene from "The
Group."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whatever you do with either of them [meaning the manuscripts],
you will doubtless be careful that the author is not exposed, and hope
your particular friends will be convinced of the propriety of not
naming her at present.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Warren was the author of several other plays, among
them "The Adulateur" and "The Retreat," which preceded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
"The Group" in date of composition, and "The Sack of Rome."
The latter was contained in a volume of poems issued in 1790,
in which "The Ladies of Castile" was dedicated to President
Washington, who wrote the author a courteous note in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>In the preface to this volume, Mrs. Warren gives her impressions
of the stage, which are excellent measure of the regard
Americans of this period had for the moral influence of the playhouse.
Thus, she writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Theatrical amusements may, sometimes, have been prostituted
to the purposes of vice; yet, in an age of taste and refinement, lessons
of morality, and the consequences of deviation, may, perhaps,
be as successfully enforced from the stage, as by modes of instruction,
less censured by the severe; while, at the same time, the exhibition
of great historical events, opens a field of contemplation to the
reflecting and philosophic mind.</p></div>

<p>But Mrs. Warren was not entirely given over to the serious
occupations of literary work. We find her on intimate terms
with Mrs. Adams, the two of them in their daily association
calling each other <i>Portia</i> and <i>Marcia</i>.</p>

<p>Who actually played in "The Group" when it was given a
performance is not recorded. We know, however, from records,
that it was given for the delectation of the audiences assembled
"nigh head quarters, at Amboyne." This evidence is on the
strength of Mrs. Warren's own statement. Sanction for the
statement appears on the title-pages of the New York, John
Anderson, issue of 1775,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the Jamaica-Philadelphia, James
Humphreys, Jr., edition of the same year.</p>

<p>I have selected this play, "The Group," as being an excellent
example of the partisan writing done at the time of our American
Revolution, and no one can afford to overlook it, although
its actable qualities, according to our present-day judgment,
are doubtful.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
